* ww

*NOTE*: This project is a work in progress and may not function correctly.

=ww= is a text editor similar to vim or nano but with a _very_ heavy Emacs influence.
It's controls are mostly default Emacs keybindings (see the help buffer in =ww= by doing =M-x help=).

Also, dependencies such as =ncurses= are not needed, just a =C= compiler.
